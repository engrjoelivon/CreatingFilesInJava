                                         Creating Files
when creating files with newfile.createnewfile();when i used the relative path,eventhough the file is 
succesfully created it was not created within the package of the program that invoked it,rather 
it was created within the project folder.eg when i created a file named file3.txt i was expecting this file 
to be inside the package Aivco because the program that created it is also there,but it was not created there
rather it was created inside the Creating file directory,ie inside the project directory that is also where the
program reside.


Absolute path defination is standard as i have always known but relative path meant i had to start from the
src folder down to the present package folder.This is because the file system goes from the project name->
the src-> then the package name
